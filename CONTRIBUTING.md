# Contributing

Small guidelines to keep the project consistent if you or collaborators edit it.

- Editing content: update `scripts/projects-data.js` with new project objects. Keep images under `assets/images/` and reference them by relative path.
- Styling: edit `styles/main.scss` and regenerate `styles/main.css` only if you know how to run Sass locally. The repo includes a compiled `styles/main.css` so there's no required build step.
- Accessibility: keep semantic HTML and `alt` text for images. Use the skip link and ensure interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.
- Commits: write clear messages (e.g., "feat: add project X", "fix: adjust modal focus").
