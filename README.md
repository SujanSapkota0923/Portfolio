# Portfolio â€” Static Site

Welcome to my portfolio repository. This static site showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a developer.

This project was conceived after a discussion with my brother regarding the feasibility of creating a portfolio site using artificial intelligence. During the development process, no code was written by me; instead, it was entirely generated by AI. Any minor modifications to the code render it no longer my work but the work of the AI. I utilized AI to modify the number even if I had to change a single character. Subsequently, I developed a fondness for this approach and decided to incorporate it into my portfolio.

The images and links associated with each project are authentic and created by me. All the projects listed are my own creations.
